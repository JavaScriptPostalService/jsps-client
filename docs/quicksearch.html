Catsnake also utilizes MessagePack so package sizes are very small making Catsnake very fast. DocsFor detailed documentation visit this link. Quickstart GuideInstall For quick use you can simply include catsnke in your &lt;head&gt;. &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/catsnake/0.2.5/catsnake.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;For installation with npm just install with npm i --save pubsuband then require it const PubSub = require('pubsub');Now connect to the PubSub server. See pubsub-server to run your own server, Otherwise you can use the example below to use our free server. (note that channel names may already be reserved, so be creative!) const cs = new PubSub('ws://catsnake.io:3081', { commonName: 'A Random Catsnake' });MethodsSubscribeBefore you can start sending messages, you should subscribe to a channel (but you don't have to). Don't worry, it's super easy. cs.subscribe('General', data =&gt; console.log(data));PublishNow that you've subscibed to a channel, let's publish a message to all of the other subscribers, and ourselves ofcourse. cs.publish('General', { message: 'Ahh! Your dog is attacking me! What is it with mail men and dogs anyways?' }).then(msg =&gt; { console.log('Yay, the server got our message.') });HistoryWanna fetch some history? Easy. cs.history('General', limit);History will be sent back in the subscribe method with the metadata.type of 'history'. InfoNice, now let's get info from the channel, this will return information like connected clients, author, etc. cs.info('General');Access ControlCatsnake gives you multiple options for access control to a channel. Denying a client access to a channel protected by access control is easy cs.deny('General', 'client-123215', 'secretKey');Granting a client access to a channel protected by access control is just as simple. cs.grant('General', 'client-123215', 'secretKey');UnsubscribeBefore exiting your application you should unsubscribe from the channel. This will leave your client in an offline state but you can later reconnect with the same client id via the new Catsnake method, we will go over this more in the advanced features below. cs.unsubscribe('General');Private ServersIn the event that you are trying to access a private server, after connecting to the server be sure to authenticate with the correct secret. cs.authenticate('mostSecureSecretEver');ContributingFor catsnake to keep up to date, and become the best tool it can be; we need contributors like you! We know trying to add your own work might be scary, what will people say? Is my code quality good enough? What if I look dumb? It's fine! Just go ahead and submit your work, worst case we'll tidy things up a bit; I'm positive we can benifit from seeing your ideas.
